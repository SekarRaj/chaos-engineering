Building fault-tolerant or resilient systems in essence means building a system that can handle faults raised and preventing total system failures.

In his book, `Designing data intensive applications`, Martin defined faults and failures as below,
Faults - A component of the system not adhering to the predefined specs.
Failure - System as a whole stops providing the stops providing services to the user.

In this blog and others, I adhere to these conventions.
